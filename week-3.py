# what statements do we know so far

# assignment statement
i= 3 # Asking to reserve memory of 4 bytes (this is the size of an integer)
        # an put the value 3 in it
f= 3.4
msg = "Hello"
message = "Hola"
condition = True
# a variable is a mermory that has a size 
# a name, an address, a value, and a type

# Another statement is a function call
# The usage of the function is called a function call

print("Hello World!") # The function takes an argunment and prints the value of it on screen

print(3)
print(f)
print(condition)

print(i, type(i))
print(f, type(f))
print(msg, type(msg))
print(condition, type(condition))

# a function call has a name, and () and in between we have an input



y = 3+4 # this evaluates to 7 so i evaluate the exp and put it in y

username = input("What is your name?") # this will evaluate to a variable

print("Hello",username)

# the casting functions
#implicit casting

x = 3
y = 4
z = x//y # floor division, rounds up to the smaller number
num = 14.5
age = int(num) # a castin function
print("Value of z is", z, ". Type of z is", type(z))
print(age)
y = 4
yf = float(y)
print(yf)
text = str(y)
print(text)

text_as_num = int(text)
print(text_as_num + 7)


# a function does something.
# but a function can also take input and output
